The screenshot test will pass reguardless of the results of the test. I had to mess with the pass several time before it saved in the right location even though the test was passing

There was some leftover data in the app for New Employee which caused issues with the new/delete test until it was removed.

Add employee and delete employee should be seperate tests since it is two different functionalities
I would also add validation to the screenshot test to check that the file has been created and is not empty.
That would make subsecent tests autopass so there would also need to have a cleanup before or after the test
