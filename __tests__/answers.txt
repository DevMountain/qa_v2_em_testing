1. Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?

    The test that verified that a user could add, edit and delete new employees is dependent on 
    the test data being unique. There is nothing in the test itselg that guarantees the test data does
    not already exist in the database. 

    This could be fixed. The test could first search for an employee matching the new data before adding the 
    new employee. That way, we would know whether there was truly a bug in the delete function or whether there 
    there was a duplicate employee already in the system.  


2. Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?

    Possibly. The first test does not cover a search that matches all the employee records in the system. This is 
    an unlikely scenario, but if the list of employee records is small and the search very broad, the test 
    would fail. 


3. What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?

    Given enough time, I would add a method to the EmployeeManager Page Object. It would be helpful to have a 
    method similar to the getEmployeeList() method, but that returned an array of the employees names as strings
    rather than an array of web elements. This would allow for easier testing using the selectCEmployee function.
