Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?

   These test are not stable enough. They need to be defined in more detail to prevent false positives from occuring. 


Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
     Yes. While doing manual testing you can see if the user experience is acceptable. Specifically, with the navigation to 
add new employee you have to go to the bottom of the page which is an odd experience. As well as when you first enter the site 
there is an empty card with verbiage of "No Employee Selected."  This would all be missed by automation. 


What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
   I would write more specific tests for each of the functionality. Make sure they are detailed enough to prevent false positives.
