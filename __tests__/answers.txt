Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
    Some of the tests aren't stable at the moment. When creating a test for employee position, 
    it will pass even if the position is wrong for the employee. Ex: Bernice Ortiz, CEO. It will pass
    with Bernice Ortiz, Moneymaker. Also, during test, the application has timed out or the process 
    was terminated for unknown reasons.
Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
    Automation is not perfect. You will miss bugs that you can find manually. When conducting
    automation, you are not testing user interaction and basic functionality of the application.
    With manual testing, you are able to test user interaction and basic functionality, and 
    are able to find bugs that would have been missed by automation.
What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
    If given enough time, I would add more timing for manual testing the application and creating simpler
    basic test for automation. By having several different tests on one file, you are more likely
    to make an syntax error. By having additional time for manual testing, you are able to thoroughly test the 
    user interaction and user interface of the application. In the long run, you would save time and fix bugs quicker
    when it comes to basic functions of the application.
