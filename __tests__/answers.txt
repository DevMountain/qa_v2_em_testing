 1. Are these test stable/will they give us false positives?
    It depends, the automation test is stable if we write a good function 
    that can test the software that meet the requirement. So for this simple Employee Manager application 
    I think the automation test is good for testing.  
  2. Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
    If the functions of the automation tests are not good enough to cover all the requirements that we need
    to pass it, it may will miss bugs and we need to manually testing. Also, we can not use automation for all the
    test, sometimes we need to use manually testing fo test the software.
  3. What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
    I would create some more automation test for each requirements of the Employee Manager or maybe some acceptance testing.
    Also create some more methods or function the test.
