Consider the following questions:
Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?


After working on these tests, I believe they can give you a false positive. I had a hard time getting the screenshot function
to save a screenshot and then getting it to save a screenshot in the correct place even though it passes the test after running it. 
I think some of these tests could definitely miss bugs that we could find manually- definitely needs more tests for finding bugs.
I would probably include a test that verifies the search function pulls up what you expect- right now with the screenshot function it 
does include names in the search but if you don't already know who has that specific title you can't really verify it without 
taking a screenshot and assuming that it did in fact find that term in an employee file- I would take it up with the devs to include a
more detailed search result so it can be verified via automated testing- plus the comsumer using the app would most likely want a 
more detailed search result.
