Question: Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
Answer: I believe that these tests are stable and have a low posibility of giving false positives.

Question: Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
Answer: Yes. These tests do not cover 100% of the functionality, and they do not take into account the user experience,
so it is likely that any automated test can miss bugs.

Question: What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
Answer: I would add in testing for more of the "features" or flow of the app, and I would also add in tests which 
should cause errors and ensure that the application is handling them appropriately.
