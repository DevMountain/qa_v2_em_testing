There are a number of issues with the current implementation which can 
cause the tests to fail under certain conditions:

1. Screenshots test

If the screenshots folder does not exist, the current implementation fails to save the 
file. An improvement to this would be to check if the folder exists, and if it does not, 
create the folder before saving the file

The current implementation also does not allow for multiple versions of the file to be saved.
This has been improved by including the date and time of when the screenshot was taken. This could be
improved further by including a function that formats the datetime into something like YYYYMMDD_hhmmss 

2. No employees with "Screenshot" title

If there are no employees with the "Screenshot" title, the screenshot test is not very useful. 
It would be more useful to take screenshots before or after expect statements
as evidence that the test passed or failed.

3. New Employee has been created but not edited

The application at the moment does not allow a new employee to be created if there is already a 
New Employee record that has been created but not edited. 
The existence of an unedited New Employeed record causes the "Can add and delete an employee" test to fail. 
An improvement could be for the application to check if an unedited New Employee record has been 
created before running the test, but would need further advice to determine 
the correct next step i.e. deleting the record, editing the record, etc. because the application is being 
shared with other testers and could result in lost data for other testers

4. Search test 

The current test for the search function only determines if the resultant list has less records than the 
full list. It does not check that the search text is found in the resultant list. It does not confirm that 
all records with the search text in any field is returned.
