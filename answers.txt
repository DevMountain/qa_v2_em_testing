Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?

as for false positives i really dont know. the tests are missing things like saving. i dont see how any saves are happening.
there is no test i see that is checking for errors or doing any data validation. are the required fields getting the proper number of characters?
id like to see some field validation added. id like to see if data is saving when navigating away or not. are saves persistant?
these tests failed. i could not get it to pass the adding and deleting employee. kept getting an error that it neds to complete adding the current employee before adding another
this would certainly be able to complete succefully with a manual test.
