Question 1 - Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?

Answer - Out of the few tests in this file, I think for the most part they are pretty stable. 
The only test you might want to go into more detail on is the the "Searching narrows the list" 
because if you search "Bill" and their is no Bill then ofcourse the results will be narrowed and 
you could receive a false positive. 

Question 2 - Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?

Answer - With there only being a couple of tests here I don't necessarily think so. That being said, I 
do think it's a good idea to run tests manually so you can experience what the user will experience.

What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?

Answer - With the little experience I have, I wouldn't make too many changes. One thing I would change, 
is the way we are testing if searching narrows the search results. Another thing I would change is move 
the "newEmployee" out of the test page and into the base page.
