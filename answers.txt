•	Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?

I think these test are stable as we have a well organized test suite. We have base class which includes all the basic functionalities for 
application and can be reused if needed. For example – initializing the browser, locators and screenshot function are included in the base class. 
We have a separate .json file which includes the employee list and can be used for API testing as well. emv2.test.ts file is importing the data 
from .json and Basepage.ts file with the test cases which are passing successfully.

•	Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
Automation works same through out the process but human minds think differently so it is possible that a tester can find something manually 
following the same process. That is why we say "testing is never enough". As and when we write more test manually, we can add them to automation. 

•	What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
1. I would like to automate my test as much as possible. It might look like a donting task in the beginning but it will help us a lot long term.
2. I would like to spend more time on API testing to ensure that the basic functionality of my application is working properly and all critical 
bugs are addressed.
