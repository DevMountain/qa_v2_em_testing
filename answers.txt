Look over the tests that are already there.
Consider the following questions:
Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?

I believe our "searching narrows the list text" could give us a false positive because
of the "greater than or equal to" line when comparing the original list length and the search
list length. Theoretically, if the search function wasn't filtering the list accurately, 
this test could still pass. If the results page pulled every person from the original list
this would still pass with automation. This bug would probably not be missed if we were 
running the same test manually because instead of cross comparing the list lengths, we woud be 
reading what results pulled up or didn't pull up after we searched. 

Our "can add and delete employee" test is giving us a false positive as well. The automation
is being executed, but in our function we don't include pressing okay on the pop up window 
that comes up after delete is clicked. Therefore, the test passes but the employee is not 
actually deleted. 

If given the time I would investigate more on how these tests could be improved our fixed. I had 
a few intial ideas for fixes, but after adding them to the code I realized they did not take care 
of the issues.
