Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
These tests are not very stable. For example:

"Can add and delete an employee" test:
- Fails if there is an employee with the name "New Employee" currently in the system

These tests can are general enough that they could give us false positives and false negatives.
For example:
"Searching narrows the list" test:
- All it checks for is that the length of the filtered list is less than the unfiltered list. This could fail if every employee matches the given search criteria.
- The search could be performing completely incorrectly, as long as it reduces the size of the list, it will pass.

Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
Yes, these tests could miss bugs that could be found manually. 
These tests don't seem to take into account some edge cases that can occur. 
For example, what happens if there are multiple employees with the same name, how would the search functionality work then and how would we test it?
These tests also don't take into account what happens if symbols/special characters are inputted, would they be accepted and how do we test it?
There is also not a test for what would happen if only spaces and nothing was inputted.
All of these things could be quickly tested manually. 

What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
I would change the "Searching narrows the list" test by:
-Making it so that any employee search result meets the search criteria. 
-I would create a test to make sure that an employee who did not meet the search criteria would be removed from the search results.
