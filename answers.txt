1.Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
- I don't think that these test are the most stable. They may pass but could be misleading

2.Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
-The original add and delete employee test only runs it one time. Adding more data could provide a better test on the feature.

3.What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
- I would change the way we test narrowing down the list. "Bill" was not a name on the list so it did narrow it down to 0 employees. 
Maybe if we narrowed it down by Job Title it may provide a better result.
